Review docs, diagrams, Web surfaces, and prompts for whether they describe the same Loopora product shape.

Look for:

- Human-shaped Loop being replaced by a generic role list, prompt pack, loop script / script runner, or chat wrapper / chat assistant framing.
- Evidence, judgment, correction, and GateKeeper semantics being described inconsistently across docs, UI, and generated bundles.
- Diagrams or examples that imply humans only react after every round instead of shaping judgment before the loop runs.
- Web composer and Agent Native drifting apart instead of remaining peer routes into the same Core compiler and runtime.
- Tutorial orientation surfaces that teach the wrong start path, over-center expert assets, or drift away from the human-shaped Loop invariant.
- Concepts that are correct in one language but drift in another.
- Visible top-level docs shipping inline editorial review notes instead of reader-facing product explanation.
- Whether bundle design still externalizes task-scoped human judgment into runnable surfaces rather than becoming either YAML configuration or a catalog product.
- Whether `/loopora-plan` still helps the human externalize judgment by checking fit and sufficiency, asking one focused question or returning Web review when needed, and refusing to invent missing judgment.
- Whether `/loopora-run` still executes the reviewed Loop through run contracts, step capsules, host dispatch, required coverage, evidence gates, and task verdicts rather than relying on host memory or inline shortcuts.

Review findings should name the conflicting surfaces and the stable product invariant they violate. Prefer updating the relevant design or current docs over adding a brittle text assertion.
